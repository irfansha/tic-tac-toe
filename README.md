# tic-tac-toe
We know that tic-tac-toe is a closed game, or less computationally intensive game. Also, we know that starting the game at middle will end up in a draw assuming both players go with optimal moves.
So, I wanted to observe which moves lead to a win/lose or a draw. Even though I have computed all possible combinations, I may have made a mistake somewhere because the results are not satifying symetric properties of the game.
In near future, I will work on this project again. May be I will extend it to much larger version.
